# **Browser-Based To-Do List Application**

This is a simple browser-based to-do list application built using ES6 JavaScript. The application allows users to manage their tasks directly in the browser, with all data stored locally using the browser's **`localStorage`** API.

## **Features**

- **Add Tasks:** Easily add new tasks to your to-do list by typing in a task description and pressing enter or clicking the add button.
- **Display Tasks:** View all your tasks with options to mark them as completed or delete them.
- **Local Storage:** All your tasks are stored locally in your browser, so they persist even if you reload the page or close the browser.
- **Edit Tasks:** Edit task descriptions directly in the list by clicking on the task and making changes.
- **Filtering and Sorting:** Filter tasks based on their completion status (all, active, completed) and sort them based on task name or completion status.
- **Clear Completed Tasks:** Clear all completed tasks from the list in a single action.
- **Data Validation:** Prevent adding empty tasks or tasks with only whitespace characters.
- **Accessibility:** Designed with accessibility in mind to ensure usability for all users.
